couldn't get current server API group list: Get "http://localhost:8080/api?timeout=32s": dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8080: connect: connection refused


couldn't get resource list for metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1: the server is currently unable to handle the request

Error from server: Get "https://172.31.22.140:10250/containerLogs/hono/eclipse-hono-adapter-http-565dff968c-cd8tj/adapter-http": dial tcp 172.31.22.140:10250: i/o timeout


kubectl get apiservice

kubectl describe apiservice v1beta1.metrics.k8s.io



Make sure that the default network security group isn't modified and that both port 22 and 9000 are open for connection to the API server.
Check whether the tunnelfront pod is running in the kube-system namespace using the kubectl get pods --namespace kube-system command.
If it isn't, force deletion of the pod and it will restart.



I forgot to open port 10250 (tcp) (in my aws security group). This was the only issue for me.
